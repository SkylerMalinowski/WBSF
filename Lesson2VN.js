		westley, "Startups like these are smaller ventures owned and operated by a small amount of individuals.  Their names may not be well known, but with enough hard work, they can expect to grow a large, successful business!",

		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "However, all companies have shares.  Even Startup ones.  However, Startup companies don't need to generate a lot of capital, so they see no need to sell shares of the company just yet.",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Therefore, the founders and initial investors of a Startup often choose to not sell shares of the company!  This way, full ownership of the company stays with the Startup's founders!",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "For example: let's assume that a startup, 'New Beginnings,' has two founders and one investor.  The founders are the people with the big ideas and the know-how, and the investor is the one with the money needed to make the idea happen.",
		westley, "In this case, 'New Beginnings' has three shareholders: the three people responsible for founding the company.  If the three of them choose to split ownership evenly, each person owns one third of the company's implicit shares.",
		westley, "The company should be able to function properly without requiring extra money if the founders keep their projects small and manageable.  Thus, they don't have to sell partial ownership to other investors.",
		westley, "During this stage, the company and its shares are considered private.  Private shares are not easily exchanged, and the number of shareholders is limited to a select handful of people",
		scene, "ClassroomInterior.jpg",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},

		westley, "This is where selling stocks come into play.  By selling stocks to the general public, the company can obtain more investment that is normally unobtainable from a limited number of investors.",
		westley, "It is at this point where the company makes an Initial Public Offering, or IPO for short.  When a company makes an IPO, they officially start selling shares of their company to the public.  At this point, they are considered a Public company, rather than a private one.",
		westley, {image: "westley_surprised.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "However, after making an IPO, the founders of the company may have to be more careful with their company.  In general, it's a good idea for the founders to hold most of the shares of the company so that they can maintain the most voting power at shareholders meetings.",
		westley, "In fact, most companies offer different types of stocks, with different benefits and drawbacks for each type.  One type might have more voting power, and another type might be a safer investment, with the latter type being sold more often than the first one.",
		westley, "This way, they are able to maintain power within the company while still raising revenue for bigger projects!",

		label, "Please Understand",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		
		westley, "Common Stock, as the name implies, is what people usually refer to when they talk about stocks.  In fact, the great majority of stock is issued in this form.",
		westley, "Common Stocks represent a claim on the profits, or divdends, of the company.  Think of it like an investment, where the investor takes an active role in the company's development.",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Due to the active role that common stock investors take, holders of common stock are allowed to vote in shareholders meetings.  The more common stock someone has, the more voting power they get!",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "That is why many higher-ups of companies own, or at least try to own, a large amount of common stock for that company.  This way, they can maintain as much power as possible, by giving themselves a stronger vote in shareholders meetings",
		westley, {image: "westley_sad.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "However, this increased benefit comes with an increased risk, as well.  Compared to Preferred Stock holders, common stock shareholders will lose a lot more if the company fails and goes out of business.",
		westley, "A company will sell its assets to covert its debts, and a common stock shareholder won't see any money from the company until its creditors, bondholders, and preferred stock shareholders are paid off first.  In fact, it's more common that, in the event of bankruptcy, common stock shareholders won't see any money out of it at all.",
		westley, "In the event of bankruptcy, a common stock shareholder will probably lose all the money that they invested with the company.",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "That's why it's important to build a diverse stock portfolio, so that you don't get into too much trouble if one company fails!",
		
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},

		westley, "Ahaha sorry, I was trying to quote an old meme just now!  Alright, so here's the stitch on Common Stocks again.",
		jump, "Please Understand",
		
		label, "Watashiwa Understando",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Ok, so the last type of Stock that I'm going to cover is Preferred Stocks!",
		label, "Best Girl",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Preferred Stock carries a smaller risk than Common Stocks.  They work similar to bonds, in that they don't confer the same voting rights that Common Stocks do.",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Instead, Preferred Stock Shareholders are usually guaranteed a fixed divident in perpetuity.  This means that a preferred shareholder will periodicaly recieve a sum of money from the corporation just for holding Preferred Stocks!",
		westley, "In the event of liquidation, preferred shareholders get another perk: if there's any money in the company left over after paying any creditors and debtors, that money goes to preferred shareholders!  Even in a terrible case scenario, Preferred Stock holders don't have to risk as much!",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "So in general, Preferred stocks have a smaller risk associated with them.  It's also worth noting that in some cases, preferred shares may be 'callable.'",
		westley, "This basically means that the company has the right to re-purchase these stocks from their holders.  However, this is usually for a premium, or a price above what it's normal traded for.",
		westley, "This is useful for when the company no longer needs to raise money by selling of partial ownershp of itself.  In essence, the company is able to buy itself back from its preferred shareholders!",
		westley, "The best way to think of a preferred share as an investment that is not as risky as a Common Stock, but with a slightly higher payout than a Bond.  If you don't remember what bonds are, feel free to drop by Lesson 1 for a refresher on it!",
		westley, "Do Preferred Stocks make sense to you now?",

			"Do you understand preferred stocks?",
			"Yes, I do", [jump, "Ram"],
			"No, can you repeat that?", [jump, "Rem"]
