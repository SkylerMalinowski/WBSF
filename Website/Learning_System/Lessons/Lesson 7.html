			<p>Once an investor has become accustomed to the Stock Market, she will start actively investing her money in Stocks, Bonds, and other investments.  However, if she doesn't keep track of what she invested in, it will be hard for her to know how much money her investments are worth.  Luckily, when investing, she can build a Portfolio containing information regarding all her assets.  A Portfolio is just a fancy term for all of one's investments.  Think of it like a folder, where inside that folder is information regarding every stock or bond that the investor owns.</p>
			<p>For the purposes of this lesson, the contents of a Portfolio will be limited to Stocks and Bonds.  However, in the real world, any investment can be considered as a part of a Portfolio.  For example, some Portfolios contain investments in Real Estate, Gold, or Foreign Currencies; if its price can hope to go up, it is worth putting in a Portfolio.</p>
			<p>Wise investing involves a lot of Portfolio management.  It involves buying and selling stocks at appropriate times, weighing the risks vs the rewards of a particular investment, and a lot of planning to ensure that the Portfolio pays off in the future.  A good investor needs to account for her own personal Risk Tolerance and Time Horizons when constructing her Portfolio.</p>

	<div class="content-space">
		<div class="h1">Risk Tolerance</div>
		<div class="left-text">
			<p>Risk Tolerance is defined as the variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand.  The higher the Risk Tolerance, the more willing an investor is to handle large changes in her assets.  Investors with a high Risk Tolerance are willing to take on risky investments that could provide a high payout should things go well.</p>
			<p>It's important to note that Risk Tolerance is a personal trait, rather than anything determined by the stock market.  Risk Tolerance is a personal measure of how much risk an investor is willing to take.  Investors who build portfolios with a high Risk Tolerance should be willing to see large fluctuations in Stock prices, and must understand that if the investment goes poorly, she may lose a lot of money.</p>
			<p>Risk Tolerance will vary greatly from person to person.  For example, an investor with 5 years left until retirement will have a lower Risk Tolerance than someone with 50 years to retirement.  The former investor does not want to lose too much money because he will not have enough time to recover if his investment goes poorly.  The latter investor may be fine with a high Risk Tolerance for now, but later on he may shift to a portfolio with a lower Risk Tolerance in the future.</p>

	<div class="content-space">
		<div class="h1">Time Horizon</div>
		<div class="left-text">
			<p>Time Horizon is how much time an investor has to play the stock market.  In other words, it's a measure of how long the investor has to meet her end goals with her investments.</p>
			<p>Like with Risk Tolerance, Time Horizons vary from investor to investor, and must be accounted for when building a portfolio.  In the previous section we mentioned two investors; one with 5 years until retirement, and one with 50 years until retirement.  This was an example that demonstrates different time horizons for different people.</p>
			<p>Time Horizons and Risk Tolerances go hand in hand.  In general, an investor with a longer Time Horizon will also have a higher Risk Tolerance to go with it.  If an investment goes wrong, then the investor with a large Time Horizon will still have enough time to recuperate his losses.</p>
			<p>However, the opposite should also be true.  An investor with a shorter Time Horizon will choose invesments with a smaller Risk Tolerance in mind.  Investors with a small Time Horizon will want to invest conservatively, in order to protect the assets that she has.</p>
