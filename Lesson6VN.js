		westley, "Today we're going to answer the question: What Stocks are Valuable?",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Well, technically speaking, all stocks are worth something.  However, in this sense, we're going to figure out if a stock is worth investing in!",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "First, let's examine what determine's a stock's worth.",
		label, "todokete",
		westley, "In general, the price of a stock is determined by the same factors that determine the price of just about anything else: the law of Supply and Demand.",
		westley, "In the case of stock, demand is modeled by the amount of motivated buyers of a stock; the number of people who wish to buy it.",
		westley, "On the other hand, supply is modeled by the number of motivated sellers, the number of people who wish to sell their stocks.",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "If there are more people motivated to purchasing a stock, the price will go up, and if there are more people motivated to selling a stock, the price will go down!  Congratulations, you've mastered High School Economics 101!", 
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide}, 
		westley, "All joking aside, the price of a stock help determines the value of a corporation.", 
		westley, "At its most basic level, the value of a stock is determined by dividing the dollar value of the company, known as the Market Capitalization, with the number of Shares Outstanding, the number of shares that exist.",
		westley, "Market Capitalization is the sum of the assets that a company has, such as buildings, machinery, patents, and other capital, and the sum of its Future Cash Flows.", 
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide}, 
		westley, "Most companies, especially companies with public stocks, exist for one reason alone: to make a lot of money.  The money that a company is expecting to earn referred to as a Future Cash Flow.",
		westley, {image: "westley_sad.png", position: rightSide}, 
		westley, "Unfortunately, while the present capital of a company, or its book value, is easy to calculate, the Future Cash Flows of a company are a bit tough to pinpoint.", 
		westley, "In fact, the unpredictability of the Future Cash Flows of a company is what causes fluctuations in a stock's price!",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide}, 
		westley, "The long and short of it is: if people think that the future cash flows of a company are substantial, then there will be more motivated buyers of that stock.  If the future cash flows are underwhelming, there will be more motivated sellers.",
		westley, "Do you understand the relationship between future cash flows and stock price?",
		menu, [
			"Do you understand future cash flows and stock price?",
			"Yeah, I got it", [jump, "nico"],

		jump, "todokete",
		
		label, "nico", 
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Great!  Now, let's get to work on determining how to enumerate future cash flows.",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "In order to do that, you have to understand the phrase 'time is money.'",
		westley, "It's more than just a phrase that people say in order to emphasize that time shouldn't be wasted.  A dollar today is not the same as a dollar in the future!",
		westley, "You see, any profits that a company will obtain in the future has to be Discounted into today's monetary terms.  This is due to factors such as inflation affecting the buying power of a dollar!",
		westley, {image: "westley_sad.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "On that note, I have to apologize to any international individuals using this app.  My creators only programmed me to reference the currency of the United States of America.",
		westley, "In this context, feel free to replace 'dollar' with any currency you see fit.",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Anyway, back to the topic at hand.  In order to convert a future dollar amount to a modern value, we must choose a Discount Rate, or a rate at which we estimate a future dollar equates to a modern one.",
		westley, "The discount rate is determined by a variety of factors, such as the cost of capital, the riskiness of the business in general, and how much money an investor could make if they did not invest at all, such as placing that money into a bank account and letting interest accrue over time!",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Although, here's a fun fact!  Let's say you choose not to invest in stocks, and instead place your money in your bank account.  The bank is still using your money to invest; your bank account is how a bank obtains its capital!",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Of course, the bank always pays you back the money that they use, plus interest.  It's all in the terms and conditions of your bank account.  I won't go into too much detail about it here, but all you need to know is that money in a bank account is being invested as we speak.",
		westley, "Anyway, once an appropriate Discount Factor has been decided on, the hard part now arises: How much money will a company make within a certain time frame?",
		westley, {image: "westley_sad.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Again, there's no easy way to do this; estimating future cash flows is determined almost by sentiment and expectations, rather than by any logical rules or equations.",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Fortunately, there's an easy-to-compute value that can help determine the future cash flows of a company: the Price to Earnings Ratio, or the P/E ratio!",
		westley, "The Price to Earnings ratio is the ratio of a Stock's Price vs the Earnings of the company, divided by the number of shares outstanding.",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "For example, if the P/E ratio of a stock is 10x, that means that a company is currently valued at 10 times its current earnings.  Likewise, a company with a P/E ratio of 20x means that the company is valued at 20 times its current earnings.",
		westley, {image: "westley_smile.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "The higher the P/E ratio of a company, the more Future Cash Flow that company is expected to have!",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "Of course, the P/E value isn't the only method that analysts use to determine Future Cash Flows, but at least you know one of them now!",

		westley, "Great!  Now, to leave you with a few key notes to take away from this.",
		label, "mm",
		westley, {image: "westley_normal.png", position: rightSide},
		westley, "One: At the most fundamental level, the price of a stock is determined by the law of supply and demand.",
		westley, "Two: The value of a company isn't determined by stock price alone.  It's determined by stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.",
		westley, "Three: While theoretically, only the future cash flows of a company should be affecting the price of a stock, in reality, a multitude of other factors, such as an investor's sentiment or attitudes, play a role in determining a stock's price.",
		westley, "And finally, four: While there are many theories that try to explain the price of a stock, there is no theory that explains everyting.",
